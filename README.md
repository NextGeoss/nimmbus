# NiMMbus
The OGC Geospatial User Feedback implementation of the H2020 NextGEOSS project developed by the MiraMon team of the Grumets research group in the Univesistat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona and CREAF

NiMMbus (http://www.opengis.uab.cat/nimmbus) -  NiMMbus is solution for storing geospatial resources on the MiraMon cloud. The system implements the Geospatial User Feedback (GUF) standard developed in the OGC www.opengeospatial.org/standards/guf (and started in the FP7 GeoViQua project). It to provide comments, ratings, questions, etc that can be associated with geospatial datasets on a catalogue using a data/metadata identifier. The initial implemention of NiMMbus being extended to the GUF in the H2020 NextGEOSS project. The system allows to creating a citation of an external resource (in an external catalogue or repository) and  associate feedback items about it. 

Here you will find 
  * the open source [code of the client](client_js)
  * the [API documentation](API) to interact with the server
  * some intructions on [how to integrate](GUF_integration) this system in existing metadata catalogues.
  
PROJECT IDEA: PROJECT IDEA: We have a Geospatial User Feedback system called NiMMbus that allows to provide comments, ratings etc that can be associated with geospatial datasets on a catalogue using a data/metadata identifier. It is based in the Geospatial User Feedback standard in the Open Geospatial Consortium. We would like to demonstrate the value of including Geospatial User Feedback for INSPIRE catalogues.
